1. Objectives depend on the scenario, but climbing the tech tree and unlocking a final tech might be the final objective.
2. Again this depends on the scenario, the base scenario is on a planet though.
3. All of the above. During early game, the player obtains resources through the outposts module, except for (crucial) minerals which can be obtained in mining missions.
4. In the standard scenario is an alien race and pirates.
5. No, there are no limitations (yet)
6. The produce and consume resources, generate status effects (e.g healing), avoid certain incidents, are prerequisites for certain crew members.
7. Yes this is a core mechanic
8. The operation of the modules are constraint by the resource flow. energy is also a resource.
9. It is focused on exploration and unlocking of lore. Rogue like aspects increase replay ability and make harsher survival aspects acceptable.
10. Blueprints and unlocked scenarios carry over to other playthroughs. Those drive the story and make it easier over time

Can you generate some lore for me to get a starting point?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a starting point for the lore of your space-themed base building game:

In the distant future, humanity has achieved interstellar travel and colonized numerous planets throughout the galaxy. However, as civilizations expanded, a mysterious cataclysm known as the Great Stellar Rift unfolded, causing vast regions of space to become impassable and cutting off entire colonies from the rest of the galaxy.

The Great Stellar Rift, an enigmatic phenomenon of unknown origin, created dangerous anomalies and spatial distortions, making travel and communication beyond the rift virtually impossible. Many colonies were left isolated, cut off from vital supplies, technology advancements, and contact with other civilizations.

As one of the last remaining factions unaffected by the initial catastrophe, the player's faction embarks on a mission to rebuild and reconnect the shattered colonies. Equipped with a state-of-the-art starship and a team of skilled engineers, scientists, and explorers, the player sets out to establish a base on a previously abandoned planet.

The abandoned planet, once a thriving hub of commerce and research, holds the key to unlocking the secrets of the Great Stellar Rift. Ancient ruins and artifacts scatter the planet's surface, hinting at an advanced civilization that once inhabited the region before its collapse.

As the player's base grows, they encounter remnants of the planet's previous inhabitants—a highly advanced alien race known as the Eldari. The Eldari, once guardians of the rift's secrets, disappeared mysteriously during the cataclysm, leaving behind traces of their technology and knowledge.

Through research and exploration, the player unravels the Eldari's history and discovers that they possessed an intricate understanding of the Great Stellar Rift. Their advanced technologies, including powerful energy manipulation and spatial manipulation devices, hold the key to overcoming the rift's challenges.

However, the player is not alone in their quest. Pirates and other factions covet the Eldari's technology and will stop at nothing to claim it for themselves. Engaging in skirmishes and negotiations, the player must navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries among various factions to protect their base, gain allies, and uncover the truth behind the Great Stellar Rift.

As the game progresses, the player's base becomes a beacon of hope, attracting settlers and refugees from other isolated colonies. These settlers bring their unique skills, aspirations, and stories, adding depth and diversity to the player's burgeoning society.

Ultimately, the player's goal is to reach the climax of the technological tree and uncover the ultimate secret of the Great Stellar Rift—a revelation that could reshape the destiny of humanity and the entire galaxy.

Feel free to expand upon this lore foundation, add new elements, or modify it to align with your vision for the game's universe.
