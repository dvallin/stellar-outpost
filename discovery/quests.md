I am working on a space themed base building game. The base has a crew that you can hire and sent on missions. Every crew member has a backstory and some personal quest line. I am undecided about the tone of the storytelling. Can you give me example quests and backstories in a cyberpunk, solarpunk, transhumanist and three more styles?

The crew members will be randomly sampled (players can choose and hire crew members) and the quests will trigger under certain conditions. Should I consider previous play-throughs? Should I avoid already solved quests or prefer previously unfinished ones?

ChatGPT
Considering previous play-throughs and the state of quests can greatly enhance the replayability and immersion of your game. Here are some factors to consider:

Quest Availability: When players start a new play-through, it's generally a good idea to make previously unsolved quests available again. This allows players to experience new content and explore different storylines. However, you can also design certain quests with branching paths or multiple outcomes, so players can make different choices and have a unique experience even if they revisit a quest they've completed before.

Quest Progression: It can be beneficial to remember the progress players have made in previous play-throughs. If a player has already partially completed a quest, you can carry over their progress to the new play-through, allowing them to resume from where they left off. This helps prevent repetition and acknowledges the player's previous efforts.

Quest Variety: To provide players with fresh experiences, it's advisable to have a wide range of quests with varying difficulties, objectives, and outcomes. Some quests can be straightforward and easily solvable, while others may require more intricate problem-solving or have complex storylines. This way, players have the option to tackle different types of quests each play-through, regardless of their previous choices or progress.

Randomization: Since crew members are randomly sampled, you can use randomization to generate new combinations of crew members and quests for each play-through. This adds an element of surprise and ensures that players have different crew dynamics and quests to engage with, enhancing the replay value of your game.

Player Choice: While randomization is important, it's also crucial to give players agency and the ability to make meaningful choices. Design quests that allow players to decide the outcome and shape the story based on their decisions. This encourages players to engage with the narrative and creates a sense of ownership over their play-throughs.

By considering these factors, you can strike a balance between providing new and exciting content while acknowledging players' previous progress, ultimately enhancing replayability and creating a more immersive experience for your players.
