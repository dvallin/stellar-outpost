How are resources consumed? Is the game real-time or round-based?
ChatGPT
In Stellar Outpost, resources are consumed based on the activities and needs of the outpost and its crew. Here's an overview of how resources are typically consumed:

Energy: Energy is consumed by various modules and activities within the outpost, such as powering living quarters, research labs, manufacturing facilities, and defense systems. It may also be required for certain expeditions and exploration missions.

Food and Water: These resources are consumed by the crew to sustain their health and well-being. As time passes, crew members require regular meals and access to clean water to maintain their morale and performance. Inadequate food and water supplies can lead to decreased productivity or even negative consequences.

Minerals: Minerals are used for construction, repairs, and upgrades within the outpost. They are consumed when building new modules, repairing damaged structures, or upgrading existing facilities.

The game in Stellar Outpost can be designed in either real-time or round-based mechanics, depending on the desired gameplay experience. Let's explore both options:

Real-time Gameplay:

In a real-time game, the activities within the outpost and the consumption of resources occur continuously without discrete turns or rounds.
Players must monitor and manage resource levels in real-time, ensuring a steady supply of energy, food, water, and minerals to meet the needs of the outpost and crew.
Real-time gameplay can add a sense of urgency and require quick decision-making, as players must respond to threats and crises promptly.
Round-based Gameplay:

In a round-based game, gameplay progresses in discrete turns or rounds, where each round represents a specific timeframe (e.g., an hour, a day, etc.).
Players make decisions and issue commands for their outpost and crew during each round.
At the end of each round, resource consumption is calculated based on the activities and needs of the outpost, and the available resources are adjusted accordingly.
Round-based gameplay allows players to plan and strategize their actions more thoughtfully and may provide a more relaxed and deliberate gameplay experience.
The choice between real-time or round-based mechanics depends on the desired pace, complexity, and overall feel of the game. Both approaches can be engaging and enjoyable, offering different gameplay dynamics and challenges.
